# R3d Cr3sc3nt Jekyll Blog

### Getting started

1. Install the `jekyll` ruby package
```
gem install jekyll
```

2. Run the test server from project root
```
jekyll serve
```

The application should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:4000.

### Adding content
New posts go in the `_posts` directory. The format for the post filenames is `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md`. More information about the jekyll directory structure can be found in [the official docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/). Static files that are linked in posts should go in a post-specific directory in `assets`. For image files, ensure that the max width is 1000 pixels and max height is 600 pixels. This helps with formatting, and keeps the repository size manageable.

When you're ready to publish, deploy by simply pushing master.
