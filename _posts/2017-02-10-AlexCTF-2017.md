## Gifted

> [gifted](/assets/actf2017/gifted)

The challenge is simply a link to an ELF binary. After downloading the binary, I ran `strings` to look for anything interesting.

```
$ strings gifted
/lib/ld-linux.so.2
libc.so.6
_IO_stdin_used
exit
...
[^_]
AlexCTF{Y0u_h4v3_45t0n15h1ng_futur3_1n_r3v3r5ing}
Enter the flag:
You got it right dude!
Try harder!
;*2$"
...
```

The flag is quickly found as a plaintext string in the binary. For further investigation, I disassembled the binary in [radare2](https://github.com/radare/radare2). The flag is being pushed as a string onto the stack just before the call to `strcmp`.

The flag is **AlexCTF{Y0u_h4v3_45t0n15h1ng_futur3_1n_r3v3r5ing}**.

## Ultracoded

> Fady didn't understand well the difference between encryption and encoding, so instead of encrypting some secret message to pass to his friend, he encoded it!  
> Hint: Fady's encoding doens't handly any special character  
> [zero_one](/assets/actf2017/zero_one)

`zero_one` is a text file containing only the words `ZERO` and `ONE` in some kind of repeating pattern. I figured this must be converted into a binary representation, so I wrote a small python script.

```
#!/usr/bin/python2.7
import binascii
import base64

data = open("zero_one").read()
dataArr = data.split()
binaryBuffer = ""

for w in dataArr:
  if "ZERO" in w:
    binaryBuffer += "0"
  if "ONE" in w:
    binaryBuffer += "1"
```

I converted the buffer string to an integer and used `binascii.unhexlify` to return the ASCII plaintext.

```
n = int(binaryBuffer, 2)
binDecoded = binascii.unhexlify('%x' % n)
```

Printing `binDecoded` reveals a base64-encoded string.

```
Li0gLi0uLiAuIC0uLi0gLS4tLiAtIC4uLS4gLSAuLi4uIC4tLS0tIC4uLi4uIC0tLSAuLS0tLSAuLi4gLS0tIC4uLi4uIC4uLSAuLS0uIC4uLi0tIC4tLiAtLS0gLi4uLi4gLiAtLi0uIC4tLiAuLi4tLSAtIC0tLSAtIC0uLi0gLQ==
```

Let's decode it!

```
base64Decoded = base64.b64decode(binDecoded)
```

Printing this output produces something resembling morse code.

```
.- .-.. . -..- -.-. - ..-. - .... .---- ..... --- .---- ... --- ..... ..- .--. ...-- .-. --- ..... . -.-. .-. ...-- - --- - -..- -
```

I couldn't find a library to decode morse code, so I built the decoded string from a python dictionary.

```
CODE = {'.-': 'A',    '-...': 'B',  '-.-.': 'C',
        '-..': 'D',   '.': 'E',     '..-.': 'F',
        '--.': 'G',   '....': 'H',  '..': 'I',
        '.---': 'J',  '-.-': 'K',   '.-..': 'L',
        '--': 'M',    '-.': 'N',    '---': 'O',
        '.--.': 'P',  '--.-': 'Q',  '.-.': 'R',
        '...': 'S',   '-': 'T',     '..-': 'U',
        '...-': 'V',  '.--': 'W',   '-..-': 'X',
        '-.--': 'Y',  '--..': 'Z',

        '-----': '0', '.----': '1', '..---': '2',
        '...--': '3', '....-': '4', '.....': '5',
        '-....': '6', '--...': '7', '---..': '8',
        '----.': '9'
        }

morseDecoded = ''.join(CODE.get(i) for i in base64Decoded.split())
```

Printing this output gave me something closely resembling the flag format.

```
ALEXCTFTH15O1SO5UP3RO5ECR3TOTXT
```

The hint in the challenge description mentioned that special characters weren't handled. After some experimentation, I determined that the O's were underscores and that the curly brackets were simply missing. Here's the final part of the python script.

```
morseList = list(morseDecoded.lower())

alexCTF = ''.join(morseList[0:7])
flag = ""

for l in morseList[7:]:
    if "o" in l:
        flag += "_"
    else:
        flag += l

print "The flag is: " + alexCTF + "{" + flag + "}"
```

This yields the flag.

```
The flag is: alexctf{th15_1s_5up3r_5ecr3t_txt}
```

## Many time secrets

> This time Fady learned from his old mistake and decided to use onetime pad as his encryption technique, but he never knew why people call it one time pad!  
> [msg](/assets/actf2017/msg)

The challenge description states that Fady is using [OTP encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad). As the name implies, the secret key in OTP encryption can only be used once, otherwise the complete key and plaintext can be recovered using a [many time pad attack (aka crib drag)](http://travisdazell.blogspot.nl/2012/11/many-time-pad-attack-crib-drag.html). Assuming that each line in the `msg` file is a line of text encrypted with the same OTP key, we can begin the crib drag by xor-ing 2 lines together and guessing possible letters.

I used the [cribdrag tool from SpiderLabs](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/cribdrag) to recover the plaintext.

```
$ python xorstrings.py 0529242a631234122d2b36697f13272c207f2021283a6b0c7908 2f28202a302029142c653f3c7f2a2636273e3f2d653e25217908
2a01040053321d06014e09550039011a07411f0c4d044e2d0000

$ python cribdrag.py 2a01040053321d06014e09550039011a07411f0c4d044e2d0000
Your message is currently:
0   __________________________
Your key is currently:
0   __________________________
Please enter your crib:
```

After a couple dozen guesses, I was able to decrypt the message as such.

```
Your message is currently:
0   Dear Friend, This time I u
Your key is currently:
0   nderstood my mistake and u
Please enter your crib:
```

Now that we have some plaintext, we can recover the key by simply xoring a plaintext string together with it's corresponding ciphertext. This can be done by modifying `xorstrings.py` slightly.

```
s1 = "0529242a631234122d2b36697f13272c207f2021283a6b0c7908".decode('hex')
s2 = "Dear Friend, This time I u"

s3 = sxor(s1, s2)

print s3
```

Running the modified `xorstring.py` script produces the flag: **ALEXCTF{HERE_GOES_THE_KEY}**.

## Hit the core

> [fore1.core](/assets/actf2017/fore1.core)

Running the 'strings' command against the downloaded file gives a bunch of random-looking output, but one line in particular stands out.

```
$ strings fore1.core
CORE
code
./code
...
AWAVA
AUATL
[]A\A]A^A_
cvqAeqacLtqazEigwiXobxrCrtuiTzahfFreqc{bnjrKwgk83kgd43j85ePgb_e_rwqr7fvbmHjklo3tews_hmkogooyf0vbnk0ii87Drfgh_n kiwutfb0ghk9ro987k5tfb_hjiouo087ptfcv}
;*3$"
(q9e
...
```

Judging by the curly brackets in one of the lines, I figured the flag might be extracted from this.
Upon closer inspection it becomes clear that every fifth character starting from the first A spells ALEXCTF, perhaps this correlation continues throughout? I wrote a python script to check.

```
#!/usr/bin/python2.7
data = "cvqAeqacLtqazEigwiXobxrCrtuiTzahfFreqc{bnjrKwgk83kgd43j85ePgb_e_rwqr7fvbmHjklo3tews_hmkogooyf0vbnk0ii87Drfgh_n kiwutfb0ghk9ro987k5tfb_hjiouo087ptfcv}"
flag = ""

for i in range(len(data)):
  if (i-3)%5 == 0:
    flag += data[i]
  else:
    continue

print flag
```

Sure enough the flag is returned: **ALEXCTF{K33P_7H3_g00D_w0rk_up}**.

```

I reconnected a few times to confirm that the server handed out random equations to be solved. After solving one manually, I was prompted with a new math problem. At this point, I wrote a python script to automate the process.

```
#!/usr/bin/python2.7
import socket

host = '195.154.53.62'
port = 1337

bot = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
bot.connect((host,port))

while True:

    data = bot.recv(1024)

    if "=" in str.split(data)[-1]:    
        equation = str.split(data)[-4] + " " + str.split(data)[-3] + " " + str.split(data)[-2]

        print "Solving equation..."
        print equation

        result = repr(eval(equation))

        print "Sending result..."
        bot.send(result + "\n")

    else:
        print data
        break
```

Running the script returns the flag after a few seconds.

```

## Hello there
> Why not drop us a few lines and say hi :).

Upon connecting to the AlexCTF IRC channel, the banner displayed the flag in plaintext.

The flag is **ALEXCTF{W3_w15h_y0u_g00d_luck}**.

## SSL 0day
> It lead to memory leakage between servers and clients rending large number of private keys accessible. (one word)

The answer is the Heartbleed vulnerability ([CVE-2014-0160](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2014-0160)).

The flag is **Heartbleed**.

## CA

> What is the CA that issued Alexctf https certificate (flag is lowercase with no spaces)

Inspect the CA certificate in Firefox.

![CA](/assets/actf2017/CA.png)

The flag is **letsencrypt**.

## Doesn't our logo look cool
> Doesn't our logo look cool?

Take a closer look at the logo of AlexCTF on the front page.

![Alexflag](/assets/actf2017/Alexflag.png)

The flag is hidden in plain sight.
It would be possible to use a python script or even `sed` to extract the flag, but you can also do it by hand.

The flag is **ALEXCTF{0UR_L0G0_R0CKS}**.
