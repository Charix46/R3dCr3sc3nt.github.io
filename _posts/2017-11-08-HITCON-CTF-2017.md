## Visual Acuity 

> Welcome to HITCON CTF 2017  
> Your flag is here:

Below the challenge prompt was a `<div>` with a very large letter `h` and presumably some other text. Inspecting the page source leads you to the flag.

The flag is `hitcon{enjoy_our_adaptive_scoring_system}`.

## Data and Mining

> My NAS is always busy...  
> [traffic-1b2b39e2c2231e6b98c77700da047b78.pcapng](https://xmunoz.com/ctfs/hitcon2017/traffic-1b2b39e2c2231e6b98c77700da047b78.pcapng)

The provided file is a 230 MB pcap. Let's download the pcap and open it in wireshark.

The first thing to notice is that much of the traffic seems to be in a protocol called "IPA". A quick google search reveals that "IPA" stands for "GSM over IP". I don't know anything about GSM over IP, but a closer inspection of the packet data reveals that this classification might be incorrect.

![ipa packet](/assets/hitcon2017/ipa.png)

That looks like good ol' HTTP to me. Wireshark has misclassified the protocol for these packets. Disable the IPA protocol by natigating to Analyze > Enabled Protcol.

![disable ipa](/assets/hitcon2017/ipadisable.png)

This didn't appear to have the desired effect for me. To really turn off IPA, go to Edit > Preferences and in the Protocols section, set the GSM IPA TCP port to 0.

This causes wireshark to rescan the whole packet capture, which can take a while depending on your hardware. Now the packet capture should look something like this.

![new packet capture](/assets/hitcon2017/newcapture.png)

It's now possible to follow the TCP streams and look for interesting data. To look at a particular stream, right click any packet > Follow... > TCP Stream.

![follow tcp stream](/assets/hitcon2017/followstream.png)

The flag is found in stream 42, which can be filtered for with the expression `tcp.stream eq 42`. The flag is `hitcon{BTC_is_so_expensive_$$$$$$$}`.
